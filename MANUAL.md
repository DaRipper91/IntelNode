## 1. User Guide

### 1.1 What Is IntelNode?

IntelNode is a high-performance **Arch Linux ARM workstation** running inside an Android userspace container. Unlike standard Linux-on-Android ports, this environment is architected for **intelligence and knowledge generation**, featuring kernel-level optimizations for the Tensor G5 processor.

### 1.2 System Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Android 10+ | Android 16+ |
| SOC | ARM64 | Tensor G5 (Pixel 10 Pro) |
| Storage | 4 GB | 16 GB+ (UFS 4.0) |
| RAM | 4 GB | 12 GB+ |

### 1.3 The Bootstrap System

Due to `systemd` being incompatible with PRoot, IntelNode utilizes a specialized two-stage initialization:
1. **`start-arch.sh`**: Initializes the D-Bus system bus, fixes permissions, and injects dynamic DNS from the Android host.
2. **`start-desktop`**: Synchronizes with the Termux:X11 display server and handles HiDPI scaling before launching XFCE4.

### 1.5 Intelligence & Knowledge Generation

The environment is pre-configured as a **Neural Processing Station**:
- **Structured Storage:** Built-in Obsidian-ready vault at `~/Vault`.
- **The Sink:** Use `to_vault` to pipe any CLI output directly into your knowledge graph with automatic metadata tagging.
- **Clipboard Bridge:** 1:1 text synchronization with the Android host via `xclip`.

## 2. Installation Guide

### 2.1 Install from APK (End Users)

Download the latest release from GitHub and install it on your device. Ensure you have Shizuku activated for optimal performance.

### 2.2 Permissions & Android 16+ Hacks

On Android 13-16+, standard storage permissions may not be enough for PRoot to operate.
- **Shizuku:** Using Shizuku via the `rish` shell bypasses common SELinux "Permission Denied" errors when extracting the rootfs.
- **All Files Access:** If prompted, granting "All Files Access" ensures the container can manage its internal state files without system interference.

---

## 3. Customization Guide

### 3.1 Hardware Acceleration (VirGL)

The environment automatically attempts to route OpenGL through the **Mali-G925 (Tensor G5)** GPU.
- **Driver:** `GALLIUM_DRIVER=virpipe`
- **Manual Toggle:** If performance is degraded, ensure `virgl_test_server` is active in the app settings.

### 3.2 High-Fidelity Audio (PipeWire)

PulseAudio has been replaced by **PipeWire** for low-latency, high-fidelity audio processing.
- **DSP Support:** Supports JamesDSP correction strings for mobile speaker calibration.
- **Bridge:** Audio is forwarded to the host via TCP port `4718`.

---

## 4. Neural Workflow Reference

### 4.1 The Intelligence Sink (`to_vault`)

Append neural text generation to your vault instantly:
```bash
# Example usage:
cat findings.txt | to_vault "Quantum_Research"
```
The function prepends ISO-8601 timestamps and frontmatter, saving the node to `~/Vault/Raw_Intel/`.

### 4.2 Rust-based Parsing Stack

Optimized utilities for manipulating large-scale intelligence data:
- `rg` (ripgrep): Instantaneous searching.
- `fd`: High-speed file discovery.
- `jq`: JSON processing for LLM responses.
- `fzf`: Fuzzy finding across your vault.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Guide

### 5.1 Android 16 ptrace Denials

Android 16 blocks certain `ptrace` system calls used by PRoot. 
- **Fix:** DaRipped automatically exports `PROOT_NO_SECCOMP=1`. If the app crashes on launch, verify this variable in the "Startup Command" settings.

### 5.2 Display Sync Timeouts

If the app hangs at "Waiting for Termux:X11", the display socket (`X4`) was not created.
- **Fix:** Open the Termux:X11 app manually and ensure it is set to Display 4.

---

## 5.3 Resetting the Environment

If the environment is completely broken, you can reset it by deleting the container in settings.
